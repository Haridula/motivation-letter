## ✉️ Motivation letter 
Dear HAMK Admissions Committee,

I would like to express my wish to take part in Häme University of Applied Sciences' Computer Applications programme. In this letter, I am going to show my intention about studying Computer Applications.

I am applying to this specific programme, because I am expecting to proceed with my studies from secondary school. I have built and published several full-stack applications on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Haridula/). Notable examples include reliable web applications created using Next.js, React, and Firebase to maintain a database. One of my published projects served as my practical work in secondary school. This experience sparked my curiosity in software development in general. I proceeded with studying programming languages like C, and Python, which I studied in a course provided by Tallinn University of Technology.

I have been seeking to study abroad to gain experience in international communication and to also improve my proficiency in English. I made the decision in favor of HAMK due to campus life, which allows me to acquire new acquaintances and focus on my studies. Additionally, the Computer Applications programme's framework is in synergy with my personal passion.

Upon my graduation, I aim to become an experienced software engineer and acquire social skills besides technical qualifications.

Yours faithfully,

Konstantin Razdolski
